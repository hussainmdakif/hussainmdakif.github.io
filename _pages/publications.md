* <h2>"Deep Learning based Bangla Voice to Braille Character Conversion System" - Published in 2022 IEEE 13th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile 
Communication Conference (IEMCON)</h2>

  * This paper introduces a system that will help visually impaired people to start their  basic education with a technology that is capable of recognizing Bangla characters. When a Bangla character is uttered by a person, our system will convert that character into a braille pattern. Afterward, a person using a finger touch can easily recognize the corresponding braille for that character. 
  * The voice recognition is done using the Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Arduino Uno. 
  * A 16x4 LCD display is used to generate the braille pattern for the recognized character.
